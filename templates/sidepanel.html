    <h1>West Side Stories</h1>

    <h2>Gentrification in West Oakland</h2>

    <p>We tend to talk about gentrification as one story: newcomers
    displace long-time residents, erasing history and disrupting
    culture in the process. But living through dramatic
    neighborhood change always brings up many stories. Those
    stories--from West Oakland's people and places--are what this
    interactive is all about.</p>

    <p>There's a lot to disagree about, when it comes to
    gentrification. But one thing seems beyond debate. If you're
    new to a place, it's good to know a thing or two about its
    history. So West Oakland's proud past is one of the most
    important stories you'll learn about in West Side
    Stories.</p>

    <h3>Hotel California</h3><img class="feature-img" src=
    "/images/hotel.png">

    <p>Built in the 1920s, the California Hotel was once a place
    that welcomed African American artists and musicians when they
    were discriminated against elsewhere. In the early 1970s, the construction of the 580 freeway and the "suburbanization" of the neighborhood took a toll on the hotel and it was shut down. Fast forward to 2011:
    the East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation and other
    supporters pulled together funds for a major renovation. Now,
    the California Hotel provides 137 units of low-income housing
    and even has a rooftop garden.</p>

    <h3>West Oakland Bart Station</h3><img class="feature-img" src=

    <p>Turf dancing is a form of street dance that is said
    to have originated in Oakland, California. According to locals,
    credit for the term goes to dancer Jeriel Bey, who created it
    as an acronym for Taking Up Room on the Floor. Dance elements include popping,
    locking, and miming. If you ride through the West Oakland BART
    station, you just might encounter a Turf dancer, making the
    most of the crowded train as a moving stage.</p>

    <h3>16th Street Station</h3><img class="feature-img" src=
    "/images/station.png">

    <p>Built in 1912 and no longer in active use, the 16th Street station was once among the largest transportation centers in Oakland. It housed the West Coast branch of the very first African American Labor Union in America and was the last stop for many African Americans leaving the South. The station is now managed by an affordable housing non-profit with ambitious plans for restoration. In the meantime, it's occasionally used for events like haunted houses and film shoots. The plaza outside the station is home to three urban agriculture projects including a workforce development program for Oakland teens.</p>

    <p>DeFremery Park is named after James DeFremery, who was the
    founder of the Savings Union Bank of San Francisco. DeFremery Park was where the
    Black Panther Party ran social and political
    activities, and the park was a distribution site for free food
    and sickle-cell anemia testing. With its landmark Victorian
    house, DeFremery Park is now a gathering place for West Oakland
    residents and families, who get together there for community
    events and rallies, exercise, fundraisers, classes, and
    celebrations.</p>

    <h3>The Mural</h3><img class="feature-img" src=
    "/images/mural.png">

    <p>U.S. Olympic sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos, gold
    and bronze medalists in the 200 meter, stood at the medal
    podium during the 1968 Summer Games in Mexico City, bowed their
    heads and held a black-gloved hand raised as the American
    National Anthem played during the victory ceremony. This was a
    mural commemorating this historic Olympic event, with images of
    the athletes and the phrase, "It only takes a pair of gloves."
    If you happen to pass by, you'll notice the mural no longer exists. The building had been used as a decontamination station, and once that work was done, the structure was bulldozed, taking the mural with it, according to Oakland Council member Lynette Gibson McElhaney.</p>

    <p>Opened in 1915, McClymonds is one of the oldest schools in Oakland and the only one in West Oakland that’s operated by the city’s school district. After an experiment with a

    comprehensive high school once again, with mostly new staff and
    teachers. The school has been known for its athletic programs.
    A few famous alumni from McClymonds are Ron Dellums, MC Hammer,
    and Bill Russell.</p>
